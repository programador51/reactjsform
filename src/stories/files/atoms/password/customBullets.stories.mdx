# Custom bullet validations

In case you need validate the text and there's not a bullet, you can create your owns, just following the same structure
showed bellow.

```ts
export interface BulletValidationI {
  /**
   * If the function you pass as argument returns true, it means that the password
   * typed by the user is correct, otherwise has an error
   */
  validationFunction: (passwordText: string) => boolean;

  /**
   * Message to display on the bullet
   */
  message: string;

  /**
   * If true, when the password is correct, the bullet will disappear
   */
  hideOnValid?: boolean;
}
```

1. Create the object (`bulletValidation`), in this case the example it's made with regex, but the code
   inside can be anything.

```js
// objectThatCanBeAnywhereYouWant.js
export const justNumbers = {
  validationFunction: (textReceivedFromComponent) =>
    /^[0-9]*$/.test(textReceivedFromComponent),
  message: "Solo numeros!!! :)",
  hideOnValid: true,
};
```

2. Pass it as param on the component

```tsx
import { Password } from "ripass";
import { justNumbers } from "your_path/objectThatCanBeAnywhereYouWant.js";

<Password
  label="My custom password label"
  showPasswordButton={true}
  bulletValidations={[justNumbers]}
/>;
```

<Password
  label="My custom password label"
  showPasswordButton={true}
  bulletValidations={[
    {
      validationFunction: (textReceivedFromComponent) =>
        /^[0-9]*$/.test(textReceivedFromComponent),
      message: "Solo numeros!!! :)",
      hideOnValid: true,
    },
  ]}
/>
